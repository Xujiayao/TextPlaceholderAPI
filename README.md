# About Placeholder API

It's a small, jij-able API that allows creation and parsing placeholders within strings and Minecraft Text Components.
Placeholders use simple format of `%modid:type%` or `%modid:type/data%`.
It also includes simple, general usage text format indented for simplifying user input in configs/chats/etc.

For information about usage (for developers and users) you can check official docs at https://placeholders.pb4.eu/!
